A boot disk is a removable digital data storage medium from which a computer
can load and run (boot) an operating system or utility program.  The computer
must have a built-in program which will load and execute a program from a boot
disk meeting certain standards.

Boot disks are used for:
o Operating system installation
o Data recovery
o Data purging
o Hardware or software troubleshooting
o Customizing an operating environment
o Software demonstration
o Administrative access in case of lost password is possible with an
  appropriate boot disk with some operating systems.
o Games (e.g. for Amiga home computers)

Linux Distro
============
Puppy Linux belongs to the family of ultra small linux distributions.
Weighing in at under 100MB, it can easily be loaded on everything from a CD to
a USB drive.  The user interface is friendly even for a non-Linux user, and
the basic tools you need for partitioning and file recovery are readily
available - although it's just as great for web browsing and basic computing.
Puppy Linux also has a rather handy feature: If you burn it to a re-writable
CD, you can save your user settings for your next session.
